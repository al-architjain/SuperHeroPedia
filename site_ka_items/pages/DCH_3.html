					Indy cars, bullet trains, supersonic aircraft... The Flash leaves them all in the dust. <br><br>
Young Barry Allen&apos; s life stopped the minute his mother was murdered. The true killer never found, its mystery obsessed Barry, driving him to become a forensic scientist. Consumed by his work, he spent his life chained to his desk, solving every case that flew across it. But when a freak lightning bolt hits a nearby shelf in his lab, Barry receives super-speed, becoming the Flash. Now, he&apos; ll race up buildings, across oceans, and around the world to get his man&mdash; while getting introduced to a world so much bigger than his old life of microscopes and cold cases. <br><br>

Able to run at near light-speeds, his powers provide the ultimate caffeine kick: He can run up buildings, move so swiftly he phases through objects, create sonic booms with the snap of his fingers&mdash; and never need to order delivery. Despite his speed, Barry can become so obsessed with crime-solving he can still lose track of everything else around him, leaving the fastest man alive constantly running a minute behind. <br><br>
