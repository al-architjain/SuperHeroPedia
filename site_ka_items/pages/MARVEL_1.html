					After the outbreak of World War II in Europe, a young American patriot named Steve Rogers was inspired to serve his country by joining the United States Army. When he attempted to enlist Steve was rejected, due to his skinny, anemic physique, and was classified 4-F. However, he garnered the attention of certain people including scientist Doctor Abraham Erskine who was searching for suitable volunteers/test subjects for a top secret experimental program designed to create an army of Super-Soldiers. As a result of Operation: Rebirth, Steve Rogers gained speed, strength, flexibility, endurance and agility of nearly superhuman levels. These heightened abilities coupled with his unwavering courage and &quot;never say die&quot; attitude eventually made him Captain America, a living legend.<br><br>
					Cap is a master of a large number of martial arts and has developed his own fighting-style which melds jujitsu, boxing, judo, karate, pressure points, all-terrain acrobatics and the use of his shield. He is also able to learn how to use most weapons quickly, as Beast has described Cap of being capable of mastering any weapon in seconds. He has used chi manipulation and many other techniques. He is a quick learner and learns these skills fast.

He is an expert with his signature shield. He can hit multiple throws by calculating ricochets. His aim is top-notch.<br><br>

Cap is also a great leader, field commander, and tactician. He led the Avengers for a long time, and his great experience makes him a seasoned commander on the battlefield. He also creates the plans for the Avengers, and has a great fighting spirit.<br><br>

He is an expert in reading codes, maps, and doing other military-related skills. He speaks English, German, Russian, Japanese, and some Italian.<br><br>
