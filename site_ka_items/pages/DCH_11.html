					Every kid wants to be Batman, but do you have a lifetime of training? A billion-dollar fortune? The dream gets dashed pretty quickly. So OK, maybe you can&apos; t be Batman... but that doesn&apos; t mean you can&apos; t be adopted by him. <br><br>
And just like that, Robin the Boy Wonder made the kid sidekick an icon. <br><br>

Acrobat Dick Grayson was the youngest member of his parents&apos;  death-defying circus act. But after their cold-blooded murder, Dick vowed revenge. Seeing a genuine piece of himself in the boy, Batman took him in&mdash; and gave him a better outlet for his anger. Becoming Batman&apos; s protégé, Robin is an expert fighter and astounding acrobat&mdash; with the toughest example in the world to live up to. But the Boy Wonder&apos; s true strength may lie in not being Batman&mdash; and providing a beacon of hope and family throughout the Dark Knight&apos; s grim crusade. <br><br>

But as Dick matures into his own entity&mdash; eventually becoming the masked crime fighter Nightwing&mdash; Robin proves more than just an identity, but a mantle passed to the most worthy. From the troubled Jason Todd to the overachieving Tim Drake, the mask is now worn by Bruce Wayne&apos; s own son Damian&mdash; a rebellious troublemaker who&apos; s been trained by assassins since birth. With a lethal skill set and a marginal sense of mercy, Robin no longer needs Batman to protect him from criminals. <br><br>
