					Imagine if the ring on your finger was more than a piece of gaudy jewelry. Instead, it&apos; s the universe&apos; s most powerful weapon. It can create whatever you wish out of pure energy, its might limited only by your imagination and will. And with it comes exclusive membership to an exclusive intergalactic police force with alien officers spanning the cosmos. <br><br>
The only catch? Mastering that power and being a Green Lantern means facing your fears, and for headstrong Hal Jordan, that&apos; s something he&apos; s been avoiding his whole life.When just a boy, Hal witnessed his greatest nightmare&mdash; his pilot father dying in a tragic plane crash. Nevertheless determined to follow in his footsteps, Hal repressed his fears, becoming a reckless, defiant test pilot. But when a dying alien crashes on Earth, the irresponsible Hal is chosen to be that alien&apos; s successor in the Green Lantern Corps, a universe-wide peacekeeping force over 3,600 members strong. <br><br>

And his life only gets wilder from there. Alien romances. Intergalactic wars. Power-hungry super-villains. Wielding a Green Lantern power ring&mdash; a weapon fueled by willpower&mdash; he can fly and create constructs made of pure energy, generating anything from massive green fists to emerald rifles that can snipe from a planet away. But while Hal tends to ignore his fears, he&apos; ll learn the only way to truly master his ring&apos; s power is by confronting and overcoming them. <br><br>
