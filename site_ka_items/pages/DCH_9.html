Nowadays, everyone&apos; s juggling an offline and online persona. But only one hero is a literal marriage of technology and man. Half human, half machine, Victor Stone is Cyborg, a digital and physical tank&mdash; and a true superhero for the modern age. <br><br>
Although a star athlete, Vic Stone only yearned for his father&apos; s approval. But Dad was too focused on his scientific career to notice... until the day Vic became his greatest experiment. After Vic suffered a grave injury, his father saved him by replacing over half his body with cybernetic parts. <br><br>

Now Cyborg is plugged into every computer on Earth, and no firewall&mdash; or brick wall&mdash; can keep him out. While his cybernetic enhancements provide superhuman strength, speed, and endurance, that same technology destroys his chances to live as a professional athlete. Now flourishing in the digital realm, Vic is desperately alone in the physical world&mdash; and still longs for his father&apos; s affection.  Hungry to find purpose again, he fights alongside the World&apos; s Greatest Super Heroes. <br><br>
