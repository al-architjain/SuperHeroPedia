					Dark Knight. Caped Crusader. World&apos; s Greatest Detective. Whatever you know him as, wherever you know him from&mdash; the blockbuster movies, TV shows, video games, cartoons, or millions of comics&mdash; Batman is proof you don&apos; t need superpowers to be a superhero... and the poster boy for what a bad childhood can do to you. <br><br>
Millionaire Bruce Wayne was just a kid when he watched his parents get gunned down during a mugging in Gotham City. The crime would define his life, as he dedicated himself to becoming the world&apos; s greatest weapon against crime&mdash; the Batman. <br><br>

Forget his Batarangs, Batmobile, or Utility Belt filled with high-tech weapons. Batman is the most feared superhero of all, because he&apos; s pushed himself to the absolute pinnacle of human achievement. He&apos; s a brilliant detective who&apos; s mastered fighting techniques the world&apos; s barely heard of. An Olympic-caliber athlete with a plan for every occasion, Batman&apos; s seemingly always five steps ahead of his foes. But in his crusade against injustice, two questions always loom: How far will he go to protect the innocent, and will he sacrifice his humanity along the way? <br><br>
