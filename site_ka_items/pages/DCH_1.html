					Look! Up in the sky! It&apos; s a bird! It&apos; s a plane! It&apos; s...Well, you know how it ends, don&apos; t you? It&apos; s a sentence so iconic, there are probably kids shouting it in Swahili as you read this.<br><br>
The most recognized superhero in pop culture, Superman has been elevated to mythic folkhero status. Rocketed to Earth from the dying planet Krypton, baby Kal-El was found by a farming couple who named the boy Clark Kent and raised him as their own. Discovering his enormous powers, they instilled in him strong moral values&mdash; and inspired him to become a hero. <br><br>

Superman has super-everything&mdash; strength, speed, flight, invulnerability as well as his renowned X-ray and heat vision. The most powerful being on the planet, his amazing abilities are also a melancholy reminder of how different he is from the people he&apos; s dedicated to protect. <br><br> 

A universal icon, Superman means different things to the many diverse people he inspires: He&apos; s an alien; an immigrant from a faraway land just looking to help; a country boy fighting the never-ending battle for truth and justice. And recent comics have truly spotlighted his role as the people&apos; s hero: Following a neophyte Man of Steel still learning his powers&apos;  limits, Superman fights the evil corporate tycoons and corrupt one-percenters that have overwhelmed the establishment. <br><br>
