					Clint Barton was born into an abusive family. He and his older brother Barney were the target of an abuse from their alcoholic father (Harold) and their mother (Edith) who didn't care. Tragedy, or perhaps poetic justice, struck when both parents died in a car accident caused by Harold's excessive drinking.<br><br>

Soon after the accident, Clint and Barney were put into an orphanage. The two escaped soon after, dreaming of a better life. While on the run, the two fell in the company of a traveling circus. Needing food and shelter, Clint and Barney decided to do odd jobs for the performers.<br><br>

Two performers, Swordsman and Trickshot, saw potential in Clint and took him under their wing. Trickshot taught Clint archery while Swordsman taught Clint acrobatics and knife throwing. The duo became heroes to Clint as he began to surpass his masters. Though Swordsman and Trickshot weren't the greatest father figures, they were the best the circus had to offer, or so he thought. While doing an odd job for a performer, Clint overheard that a great sum of money had been stolen from the ringmaster the night before. Clint thought little of this until he saw Swordsman with an very large amount of money and wondered if his hero could have been the thief from the night before. He questioned his mentor and got the answer he was dreading; Swordsman had indeed stolen the money. Swordsman was quick to offer Clint a cut of the stolen cash if he kept his mouth shut, but he refused and was soon chased, beaten and left for dead by Swordsman. Unable to handle the pain he felt, Clint bolted again. Clint was soon contacted by Barney. Disappointed that Clint left the circus and angry that he was alone, Barney lashed out at his brother. Feeling guilty for leaving his brother, Clint reluctantly agreed to return to his old life.<br><br>

Clint felt unappreciated and alone at the circus. His act, "The Amazing Hawkeye" got little attendance. Much to his dismay, his performance was ignored when Iron Man stopped a run away ride. After seeing Iron Man in action, Clint was inspired to use his archery skills to fight crime.<br><br>
